[Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array on LeetCode](https://leetcode.com/problems/remove-duplicates-from-sorted-array/)

Intuition
Because nums is sorted, duplicates will always be right next to each other. I never have to search forward or backward beyond immediate neighbors to check for duplication.

I want to build a ‚Äúprefix‚Äù of unique values at the front of the array, overwriting the duplicates as I go.

Use a pointer k (or ‚Äúwrite position‚Äù) to track how many unique values I‚Äôve kept so far. Every time I find a new value (one that differs from the last unique), write it at nums[k], then bump k.

Approach
Initialize k = 0 ‚Äî this will be where I place the next unique value and also represents how many uniques I have seen (since first unique will fill at index 0).

I loop through every element number in nums:

If k == 0, this is the first element; it‚Äôs unique by default.

Or if number != nums[k-1], it‚Äôs different from the last unique you wrote ‚Üí a new unique.

When it‚Äôs a new unique, set nums[k] = number, then k += 1.

If it‚Äôs a duplicate (equal to nums[k-1]), skip it.

After the full loop, k is count of unique elements; the first k positions of nums are the unique ones, in sorted order. Return k.

Complexity
Time complexity:
O(n), where ùëõ is the length of nums. You walk through the array exactly once, doing constant work per element.

Space complexity:
O(1) extra space. You only use a few variables (k, loop variable, etc.). You modify the input array in place. No large auxiliary structures.
